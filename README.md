# Elvarg
<b>This is a personal project based on Runescape Elvarg 317 project</b> - https://github.com/camelot317/Elvarg for an <b>own challenge and educational</b> propose.
Since 2006 I started playing Runescape at 9 age. It has been the game which I played for longer. I always wanted to know how it was made, all it's secrets on gameplay etc. Now, using Elvarg 317 project base, I'm going to discover by myself and try to code some improvements.
